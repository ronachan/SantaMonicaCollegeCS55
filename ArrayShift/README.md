# Array Shift
Write a program that tallows to input an integer for the size of an array. Randomly generate an integer for each element of the array. Next, create a function to rotate the array. Rotation of the array means that each element is shifted right or left by one index, and the last element of the array is also moved to the first place.


**Example:**

Enter the number of slots needed in the array: 8\
These are the elements of your array: 9 57 18 96 6 49 31 83\
Which direction to shift R/L: R\
How many times: 2\
These are the elements of your array: 31 83 91 57 18 96 16 49
