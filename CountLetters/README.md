# Two arrays count letters
Write a complete program using two arrays, upper and lower to keep the upper and lower alphabet respectively.\
Ask the user to enter string example: **This is a test from Jupiter. Soon you will see who is from Jupiter!!! May be Dr. D.**

Your program should parse the string and keep track of number of alphabet. Both arrays are indexed from 0 to 25. The logical way to do this is to use upper[0] to count the number of 'A;, and upper[] to count number of 'B' and so on. Likewise for the lower array.

Output should look like:\
A:0          a:2\
B:0          b:0\
...
