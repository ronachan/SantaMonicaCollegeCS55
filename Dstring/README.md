# Dstring
Write a program that reads a string from the keyboard. If the length of the string is an even number, your program should split the string into two strings of equal length. If the length of the string is odd, your program should split the string into two strings where the first part has one more character than the second part. Your program should output the two strings it created.

**For example:**

    Input:        2BeOrNotToBe
    Output:       2BeOrN
                  otToBe
                  
    Input:        ToBeOrNotToBe
    Output:       ToBeOrN
                  otToBe
                  
Please save the program with the name **'Palindrome.java'**\
Write a method which returns true if the string parameter is a *palindrome*. A palindrome is any "word" which is the same forward and backward ("radar", "noon", "20011002", ...). The function should return false if the argument is not a palindrome.
