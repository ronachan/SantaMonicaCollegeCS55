# SuperSubClass
Design a class named ***Person*** and its two subclasses: ***Student*** & ***Employee***. Make ***Faculty*** and ***Staff*** subclasses of ***Employee***.\
***Person***: name, address, phone #, and email address.\
***Student***: class status (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior) - constant\
***Employee***: office, salary, date-hired (***MyDate***: year, month and day)\
***Faculty member***: office hours and rank\
***Staff member***: title\
Override the *toString* method in each class to display class and person's name.\
Write a test program that creates a ***Person, Student, Employee, Faculty,*** and ***Staff***, and invokes their *toString()* methods.
