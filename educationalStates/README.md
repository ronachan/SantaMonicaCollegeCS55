# educationalStates
USA States is an educational game directed toward people who are interested in learning about the 50 states. When in the 'Study' mode, the user can click on each state to see that state's capital and state flag. After studying all the states, the user can navigate to the 'Learn' mode which will provide 5 questions in a pop out box quizzing the user on their knowledge of the state capitals.

Instructions:
- A copy of the 'Map' folder must be located on the desktop of the machine
- Run the program from the .exe or .jar file. You can also run RunProgram.class in the 'Program Code' folder using the JVM

This was a group project when I was a student at Santa Monica College in 2017. My group and I did not complete this project, so for demo purposes, only a handful of questions are provided in the 'Learn' mode. If we had more time, we would have created a more appealing interface and included quiz questions about all the states.
